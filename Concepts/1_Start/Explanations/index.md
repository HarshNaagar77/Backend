This code is written in JavaScript using the Express.js framework for building web applications. It defines an Express application that listens for HTTP requests and sends back responses.

First, the code imports the dotenv module to load environment variables from a .env file. This is a common practice for managing configuration settings for an application.

Next, the code imports the express module and creates an instance of an Express application using the express() function.

The application defines two routes using the app.get() method. The first route is for the root path ('/') and sends the message 'Hello World!' as the response. The second route is for the path '/login' and sends the message 'This is a login page :)' as the response.

Finally, the application starts listening for requests on the port specified in the environment variable PORT using the app.listen() method. When the application starts, it logs a message to the console indicating the port number it is listening on.

Overall, this code sets up a simple Express application with two routes and listens for incoming requests on a specified port.
